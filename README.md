# :anchor: Anchor

From the creator of the songs:
> Anchor is an app that was designed to help neurodivergent people who are feeling anxious and/or nervous. The songs were made with the specific intention of being an 'anchor' for someone who is distressed. They feature repetitive melodies, rhythms and soft sounds to try and create a soothing and consistent environment. The app won't be for everyone, but I hope that it helps you in moments when things are overwhelming.
