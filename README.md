## 📖 About the Project

From my brother, the creator of the songs:
> Anchor is an app that was designed to help neurodivergent people who are feeling anxious and/or nervous. The songs were made with the specific intention of being an 'anchor' for someone who is distressed. They feature repetitive melodies, rhythms and soft sounds to try and create a soothing and consistent environment. The app won't be for everyone, but I hope that it helps you in moments when things are overwhelming.


### 🎧 The Audio Engineering

The songs in Anchor aren't just "relaxing tunes" - they are tools designed with specific auditory constraints:

- **Frequency control** - mixed to minimize harsh or resonant frequencies that can trigger sensory sensitivity
- **Consistency** - high usage of reverb and repetitive melodies to create a predictable, safe soundscape
- **Dynamic Stability** - unlike radio music, these tracks avoid sudden spikes in volume or instrumentation

### 🎚️ Complexity Levels

The app features 15 songs divided into three levels, allowing you to choose the right stimulation for your current state

| Level | Purpose | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1 | The Anchor | The core of the app. Very few instruments and almost no variation. Designed for moments of high distress or overload |
| Level 2 | The Balance	| A middle ground. Introduces slight variations and instrumentation while maintaining strict repetitive patterns |
| Level 3 | Relaxation | Designed for decompressing before things get too much. More musical variation and structure, but still free of harsh frequencies |


### 🎨 Design Philosophy

The calming approach extends to the user interface. We believe an anxiety app shouldn't add to the noise.

- **No Ads** - Ads are loud, flashy, and stressful. Anchor has *none*
- **Sensory friendly** - no bright or harsh colors, the UI uses a muted palette
- **Minimalist** - reduced clutter to make navigation effortless when you are feeling overwhelmed
- **Predictable** - we avoid unnecessary design overhauls. The interface is built to stay familiar and consistent, so you always know exactly where everything is
